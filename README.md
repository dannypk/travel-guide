# Travel Guide

Do you need to travel somewhere soon? Then use another website. 
This one is not yet ready. Thanks!

Joke apart, the purpose of this website is to **show a sample of how I write code**. The 
project is not in a final stage and I am not a designer, so please don't judge too much
the aspect of the website.

The service for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/dannypk/travel-guide-service)


### In this project you can see some usages of
* [NextJS](https://medium.com/@daniel.pacurici/next-vs-nuxt-87aa957d5967)
* ReactJS (including react hooks)
* MobX (for state management)
* LESS
* [Own eslint configuration](https://github.com/dannypk/eslint-easy-configuration)
* Husky

### Hosting
The app is hosted using Now and can be reached [here](https://travel-guide.dannypk.now.sh/)

*Please note that if there are no results at first, is because the heroku server needs 
to be awaken (since I pay no dynos for heroku). After a couple of seconds, either
try again or reload the page and try again.*

### TODOs:
* add more content, more services, more logic
* add new feature (creating guides)
* create responsive design
